Clash Portfolio: A Medieval-Themed Frontend Developer Showcase
This creative portfolio website presents John Doe's web development skills through an immersive Clash of Clans-inspired medieval theme. The site features:

Fortress Design: Rich parchment textures, golden emblems, and medieval castle aesthetics throughout the UI
Village Overview: About section styled as interactive village buildings that reveal personal background information
Troop Levels: Skills visualized as battle-ready troops with level indicators and progress bars
Interactive Troop Cards: Project showcase with flip-animation cards displaying work samples with descriptions
Clan Chronicle: Professional experience timeline styled as a medieval scroll of achievements
Clan Mail: Contact form designed as a parchment message system
The portfolio effectively combines modern web technologies (React, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript) with fantasy-themed visual elements to create an engaging user experience that demonstrates both technical expertise and creative design skills.

Perfect for frontend developers looking to showcase their work through a distinctive and memorable presentation that stands out from traditional portfolios.
